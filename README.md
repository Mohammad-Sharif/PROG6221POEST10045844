POE Part 2 

The program is Visual Studios Project where a Console App(.NET Framework) is used. 

The program is a recipe maker where it will allow a user to create a recipe from details such as ingredients, quantity and measurement units. It will also allow user to scale values such as quantity to half it, double or triple it. It will also allow the user to revert such changes (Hillary Nyakundi,2021). 

Update: 

New features: 

-allows a user to create unlimited number of recipes (correction from the previous part 1 submission) 

-allows user to add further details to the recipe such as food group and calories  

-provides total (sum of calories) of calories in the recipe from each ingredientâ€™s calories. 

-Scaling will now also scale the calories in the recipe as well. 

-allows a user to pick from a list of recipe names to display that chosen recipe (Hillary Nyakundi,2021). 

What I have Changed from lecturer feedback in POE part 2 is steps and ingredients are stored in a generic collection and that delegates are used in the 300 calories exceeding notification to the used.
